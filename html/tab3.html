<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>Analysis about the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <p>
    The analysis of the graph shows a decrease in electricity consumption in the
    last 5 months of the public services bill. An inverse relationship between
    variable x (months) and variable y (consumed KWh) can be clearly observed.
    This indicates that as the months increase, the consumed KWh decreases.
    Additionally, it can be appreciated that the graph has a negative slope,
    reinforcing the idea that electricity consumption is decreasing as time
    passes. <br />
    Examining the data, the first month shows the highest electricity
    consumption with 231 KWh consumed. For the following month, there is a
    reduction of 37 KWh compared to the previous month, indicating a significant
    decrease in electricity consumption in a short period of time. Although
    there is an increase in electricity consumption in the third month, it is
    only 8 KWh, which is considered insignificant in the context of the
    analysis. In the fourth month, there was another reduction in electricity
    consumption, although not as large as in the second month, suggesting that
    the decrease in electricity consumption is stabilizing. Finally, in the
    fifth month, there was only an increase of 1 KWh, indicating that
    electricity consumption has remained stable. <br />

  </h5>

  <p>
    $$ y=-6.00 \cdot 6 + 222.80 $$ $$ y=186.80 \text{ kWh} $$
  </p>
  <h5>
    conclusion
  </h5>
  <p>
    In summary, the graph shows a downward trend in electricity consumption over
    the past 5 months. This analysis is important to identify possible
    energy-saving measures and cost reduction in the household. Additionally, it
    is important to continue monitoring electricity consumption to identify
    possible fluctuations and take preventive measures since although
    consumption decreases and reaches stability in the last two months,
    consumption cannot be neglected as it could affect the achieved stability.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  The presented graph shows the relationship between the amount of consumed KWh
  and the number of people living in the property. A positive slope is observed,
  which indicates that as the number of residents in a property increases, the
  consumption of electrical energy in KWh also increases. This result is
  important because it allows us to understand that the amount of energy used is
  directly related to the number of people living in the property, which can be
  useful when planning energy consumption. <br />
  <br />
  If we analyze the presented data point by point, we can observe that the range
  of KWh spent in houses inhabited by two people ranges from 115 to 155KWh. In
  houses where three people live, the range ranges from 53 to 144KWh, while in
  houses inhabited by four people, the range ranges from 184 to 239KWh. These
  data are important because they allow us to compare energy consumption between
  different types of households. <br />
  <br />
  It should be noted that, although the graph shows an upward increase in the
  consumption of electrical energy as the number of people in the property
  increases, points with considerably large differences in energy consumption
  are also observed. For example, the lowest consumption in houses where two
  people live is 115KWh, while in houses where three people live, the minimum
  consumption was 53KWh, representing a difference of 62KWh in energy
  consumption between two households with a difference of only one person in the
  number of inhabitants. This result may be interesting for investigating
  specific cases and better understanding how other factors influence the energy
  consumption of a property.

    people live.
  </h5>
  <p>$$ y=31.06 \cdot 200 + 46.12 $$ $$ y= 6258.12 \text{kWh}$$</p>

  <h5>
    conclusion
  </h5>
  <p>
    Finally, the graph presented when showing the relationship between the
    amount of kWh consumed and the number of people living in the property can
    be useful for planning energy consumption. Additionally, this information
    can be used to identify consumption patterns and determine possible changes
    that may have an impact on consumption. For example, households that consume
    more energy than they should can be identified and offered suggestions on
    how to reduce their consumption. The data also allows for a comparison of
    consumption between different types of households, such as houses and
    apartments, and analyzing the differences in energy consumption between
    households by comparing differences in the number of occupants. Overall,
    this information can be very useful for improving energy efficiency and
    reducing households' carbon footprint.
